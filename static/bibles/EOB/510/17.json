{"chapter":{"1":{"verse":1,"text":" After passing through Amphipolis and Apollonia, Paul and Silas arrived in Thessalonica where there was a Jewish synagogue."},"2":{"verse":2,"text":"As was his custom, Paul gave them his attention and for three Sabbath days, he reasoned with them from the Scriptures."},"3":{"verse":3,"text":"He explained and showed that the Christ had to suffer and rise again from the dead, saying, “This Jesus whom I proclaim to you is the Christ.”"},"4":{"verse":4,"text":" Some of the Jews were convinced and joined Paul and Silas, together with a large number of God-fearing Greeks and not a few of the leading women."},"5":{"verse":5,"text":"But the unconvinced Jews took along some wicked men from the marketplace, gathered a crowd and set the city in an uproar. Assaulting the house of Jason, they sought to bring them out to the people."},"6":{"verse":6,"text":"But not finding them, they dragged Jason and some of the brethren before the city officials, shouting, “These people who have turned the world upside down have also come here,"},"7":{"verse":7,"text":"and Jason has received them! All of them act in opposition to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus!”"},"8":{"verse":8,"text":"The multitude and the city officials were troubled when they heard these things."},"9":{"verse":9,"text":"After receiving a bond from Jason and the others, they let them go."},"10":{"verse":10,"text":" At once, the brethren sent Paul and Silas away by night to Beroea. When they arrived, they went into the Jewish synagogue."},"11":{"verse":11,"text":" Now the Beroeans were more open-minded than the people of Thessalonica: they received the word with great eagerness of mind and examined the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were true."},"12":{"verse":12,"text":"As a result, many of them believed, as well as some Greek women of high standing, and a fair number of Greek men."},"13":{"verse":13,"text":"But when the Jews of Thessalonica learned that Paul was also proclaiming the word of God at Beroea, they came there to stir up the crowds."},"14":{"verse":14,"text":"Then the brethren immediately led Paul away to the coast, while Silas and Timothy remained there."},"15":{"verse":15,"text":"But those who escorted Paul took him as far as Athens, and they left instructions for Silas and Timothy that they should join Paul very quickly. Then they departed."},"16":{"verse":16,"text":" Now as Paul was in Athens waiting for them, his spirit was greatly distressed to see that the city was full of idols."},"17":{"verse":17,"text":"And so, he began to debate in the synagogue with the Jews and the [Gentile] God-fearers, and every day in the marketplace with the people that he met."},"18":{"verse":18,"text":"Some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers also had discussions with him. Some said, “What is this babbler trying to say?” Others suggested, “He seems to be advocating foreign deities,” because he was preaching to them Jesus and [Anastasin] ‘the resurrection’."},"19":{"verse":19,"text":" So they took him [by the arm] and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, “May we know what this new teaching that you proclaim is all about?"},"20":{"verse":20,"text":"You certainly bring some strange things to our ears! Therefore we want to know what all this is about.”"},"21":{"verse":21,"text":"Now all the Athenians and the strangers living there spent their time doing nothing else, but either to tell or to hear some new thing."},"22":{"verse":22,"text":" So Paul stood in the middle of the Areopagus, and said, “Athenians! I perceive that you are very religious in all things."},"23":{"verse":23,"text":"In fact, as I passed along and observed your sacred monuments, I also found an altar with this inscription: ‘To an unknown God.’ Therefore, the one you revere in ignorance, this one I announce to you!"},"24":{"verse":24,"text":"The God who made the world and all things in it, being Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in sanctuaries made with hands!"},"25":{"verse":25,"text":"Neither is he served by human hands, as though he needed anything, since he himself gives to all life, breath, and everything else."},"26":{"verse":26,"text":"From one blood, he has made every nation to dwell on the entire surface of the earth (having determined the times and boundaries of their habitation)."},"27":{"verse":27,"text":"God did this so that people should seek the Lord and perhaps reach out for him and find him, although he is not far from each one of us."},"28":{"verse":28,"text":"‘For in him we live, and move, and have our being!’ As some of your own poets have said, ‘For we are also his offspring.’"},"29":{"verse":29,"text":"Since we are God’s offspring, we should not think that the divinity is like gold, silver, or stone, engraved by human art and imagination."},"30":{"verse":30,"text":"In the past, God overlooked such ignorance, but now, he commands that all people everywhere should repent,"},"31":{"verse":31,"text":"because he has appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness by the man whom he has ordained. He has given assurance of this to all by raising him from the dead.”"},"32":{"verse":32,"text":" Now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked; but others said, “We want to hear you again on this matter.”"},"33":{"verse":33,"text":" Paul then left their company."},"34":{"verse":34,"text":"Still, a few men joined with him and believed, among whom also were Dionysius the Areopagite and a woman named Damaris and others with them."}},"meta":{"connection":"EOB","book_number":510,"chapter_number":17,"previous_chapter":{"connection":"EOB","book_number":510,"chapter":16},"next_chapter":{"connection":"EOB","book_number":510,"chapter":18}}}
