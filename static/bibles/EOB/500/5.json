Then whoever stepped in first after the stirring of the water was made whole of whatever disease he had ."},"5":{"verse":5,"text":" A certain man was there, who had his illness for thirty-eight years."},"6":{"verse":6,"text":"When Jesus saw him lying there and perceived that the man had been sick for a long time, he asked him, “Do you want to be made well?”"},"7":{"verse":7,"text":" The sick man replied, “Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up, but while I am coming, someone else steps down before me!”"},"8":{"verse":8,"text":" Jesus said to him, “Arise, take up your mat, and walk!”"},"9":{"verse":9,"text":" Immediately, the man was made well; he took up his mat and began to walk.

Indeed, whatever the Father does, the Son also does likewise."},"20":{"verse":20,"text":"For the Father has deep affection for the Son, and shows him all things that he himself does. And the Father will show him greater works than these, so that you may be astonished."},"21":{"verse":21,"text":"For [just] as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, likewise the Son also gives life to whom he desires."},"22":{"verse":22,"text":"As it is, the Father judges no one, but he has given all judgment to the Son,"},"23":{"verse":23,"text":"so that all may honor the Son even as they honor the Father.
